    <h3>Living in Gothenburg</h3>
    <p>Still, Gothenburg is green and making the most of its riverine and maritime location,
    featuring many parks and canals. There are also many historic monuments from its relatively 
    short but glorious past, and evidence of the Dutch-sourced city planning which makes Gothenburg share traits with Amsterdam and Jakarta. It also has a youthful side to it, with over 60,000 students (Gothenburg University is the largest in Scandinavia). Gothenburg has a reputation
    of being a friendly place, even more welcoming than Stockholm, the Swedish capital.</p>

    <h3>What to do?</h3>
    <p>There is alot of things to do in Gothenburg, like for example visit Liseberg. Head-spinning rides,
    carousels and concerts are an essential part of summer. In Ocotber there is fantastic
    Halloween theme and later in November the park opens up for Christmas at Liseberg (see picture below).
    Oh and it is Scandinavia's largest amusement park.<br>You can always visit Haga
    - This charming neighbourhood has a wonderful selection of cafés and small artisan shops.
    You might like to try a giant cinnamon bun on Haga Nygata.<br><br>
    Just a stone’s throw from the city centre is the Garden Society of Gothenburg (Trädgårdsföreningen)
    – one of the best preserved nineteenth-century parks in Europe. A short tram ride away you'll find Gothenburg Botanical Garden,
    a world class botanical garden with more than 16 000 different species of plants.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>The history of Gothenburg begins with the foundation of the heavily fortified town in 1621,
    during the Thirty Years' War, when Sweden was once-again in armed conflict with Denmark–Norway. The location of the new trading port,<br>
    Sweden's only direct access to the North Sea and Atlantic, was highly strategic: the result of centuries
    of conflict with the Norwegians just to the north, in Bohuslän, and the Danes, just to the south in Halland.<br><br>
    Within the 19th century, Gothenburg evolved into a modern industrial city that continued on 
    into the 20th century. The population increased tenfold in the century, from 13,000 (1800)
    to 130,000 (1900). In the 20th
    century, major companies that developed included SKF (est. 1907) and Volvo (est. 1926).</p>

    <h3>Study in Gothenburg</h3>
    <p>There are two universities in Gothenburg, and both of them rank among the best in the world - making the city a
    particularly popular destination for those seeking to study in Sweden. 
    The University of Gothenburg (Göteborgs universitet) with 37,000 students
    is Sweden’s third-oldest university. Founded in 1891, it has long since developed in one of the region’s most important hubs for research
    and education.<br><br> Its most notable alumni include former ABB chairman Percy Barnevik, nobel prize laureate Arvid Carlsson (for medicine),
    and bestselling author Jonas Jonasson (“The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared”).<br><br> 
    The city’s second-largest institution, Chalmers University of Technology (Chalmers tekniska högskola), focuses on technology, natural sciences, related management disciplines. Its 11,000 students came for the world-class education in engineering and computer science. Chalmers also spawned 
    numerous notable alumni, such as nobel laureate Gustaf Dalén, Ludvig Strigeus (the original 
    developer behind Spotify), and one of Sweden’s most famous college dropouts, YouTube star Felix Kjellberg (also known as “PewDiePie”).</p>
