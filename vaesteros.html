    <h3>General information</h3>
    <p>Västerås is a city in central Sweden, located on the shore of Lake Mälaren in the
    province Västmanland, some 100 kilometres west of Stockholm. The city had 
    a population of 119,372 inhabitants in 2016, out of the municipal total of 150,000 (2017). Västerås is the seat of Västerås Municipality, 
    the capital of Västmanland County and an episcopal see.<br><br> The city remains one of the main logistical centers in Sweden due to its central location in the densely populated
    region Mälardalen and favourable infrastructure connections with railways, waterways and highways. 
    Amongst others, ICA AB has one of its main distribution centres located in Västerås. Västerås is the birthplace of multinational clothing retailer H&M.
    Their first store was opened in the town centre in 1947.</p>

    <h3>What to do?</h3>
    <p>Highly recommended if you’re in Västerås with younger members of the family, the Kungsbyn 
    Animal Park is a small but well-run zoo.There are both exotic and domestic animals here, 
    and lots of opportunities for little ones to interact.<br><br>
    Under ten kilometres east of the centre of Västerås is Sweden’s largest barrow
    (burial mound). This is nine metres in height and 64 metres across and dates back at
    least 1500 years. It is claimed to be the resting place of the semi-legendary 
    King Bröt-Anund from the House of Yngling.<br><br>
    We can bet that you’ve never set foot in a water park like this.
    Kokpunkten is eight floors of slides and pools in the confines of a former steam power station
    on the east side of the city. The monolithic building, celebrating its centenary
    in 2017, is a popular fixture in Västerås’ cityscape, right on the shore of Lake Mälaren.    
    The plant was shut down in 1992 and in the 2000s it was slowly reworked into this unique
    attraction.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Västerås is one of the oldest cities in Sweden and Northern Europe. 
    The name originates from Västra Aros (West Aros), which refers to the river mouth of Svartån. 
    The area has been populated since the Nordic Viking Age, before 1000 AD. 
    In the beginning of the 11th century it was the
    second largest city in Sweden, and by the 12th century had become the seat of the bishop.
    Today, Västerås is predominantly known as an industrial city, but also a retailing and logistics city.</p>

    <h3>Study in Västerås</h3>
    <p>Compare too all the other cities, Västerås is not the biggest nor the most well-known study city, in Sweden,
    but 15 000 students read courses and study programmes in Business, Health, Engineering and Education. 
    They conduct research within all areas of education and have internationally outstanding research in 
    future energy and embedded systems. Our close cooperation with the private and public sectors enables them 
    at MDH to help people feel better and the earth to last longer. </p>
