    <!--How it wants to become to northern city point with CPH-->
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Malmö was one of the earliest and most industrialized towns of Scandinavia,
    but it struggled with the adaptation to post-industrialism. Since the construction of the Øresund Bridge, Malmö has undergone
    a major transformation with architectural developments, and it has attracted new biotech and IT companies, 
    and particularly students through Malmö University, founded in 1998.
    The city contains many historic buildings and parks, and is also a commercial centre for the western part of Scania.</p>
